# Data Explorer

The Data Explorer allows you to visualize and interact with MQTT messages. These messages carry all data processed by Connectware and are organized into topics for structured data flow between publishers and consumers.

You should now see the data of your welding robot!

For monitoring the MQTT topics of a single service, use the Live Data tab (*Services > Click a Service > Live Data tab*).
