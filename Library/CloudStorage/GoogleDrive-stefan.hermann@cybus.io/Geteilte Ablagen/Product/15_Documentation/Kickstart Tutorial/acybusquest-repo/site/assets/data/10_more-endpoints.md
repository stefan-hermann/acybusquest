# More Endpoints

Your machine has of course more than only one endpoint. So let's connect them all.

## How to do it:

1. Open the [CODE: Service Commissioning File](assets/yaml/03_welding_03.cw.yaml)
2. In the ressources, you find five more endpoints
3. Download the [DL: Service Commissioning File](assets/yaml/03_welding_03.cw.yaml)
4. Upload into Connectware (*Services > Upload Service*)
5. Enable the Service
6. Inspect the Data in the Data Explorer
