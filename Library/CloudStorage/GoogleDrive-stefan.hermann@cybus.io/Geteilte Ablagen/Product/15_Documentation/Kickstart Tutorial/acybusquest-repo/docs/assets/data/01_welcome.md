# Welcome to your journey with Cybus Connectware

In this tutorial we will set up Cybus Connectware, install machine simulators, connect to them and automate the workflows.
Even though the machine data is simulated, everything else is 100% factory digitization. That's how it's done properly and quickly.

We will use a host system running Ubuntu and Docker Compose. Skip the installation steps if you already have this set up.

You will need a valid Licence key. You can request it per mail: [Request License Key](mailto:getCWlicense@cybus.io)
